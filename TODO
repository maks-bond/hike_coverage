1. Ensure that there are no jumps of the map when recording at all. Currently it seems to jump to the initial location. Unclear when.
2. Visualize route while recording. This regressed.
3. Change the color of selected route. Currently it is green which doesn't work.
4. Compute the distance in miles for each route. Store it too.
5. Store the route in the cloud.
